# Lab5: Using Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC)

Lab 5
  *  Press B1 to use ADC to measure voltage
  *  When green LED is on, VR1 and VR2 measured as minimum voltages 
  *  When red LED is on, VR1 and VR2 measured as maximum voltages 
  *  Both measurements update 'scaledVR1' and 'scaledVR2' variables respectively 
  *  VR1 determines the on time of the flashing shield LEDs, VR2 determines the off time
  *  Pressing B1 after callibration (setting min and max voltages) will turn the system off. Pressing B1 again will resume.
  *  Trying to record a max voltage that is equal to or less than the minimum voltage recorded will result in error (blue flashing led). Reset the system from here. 
  *  Observe variables using debugger
