# Embedded-Systems-Labs
Labs done in my embedded systems module programming in C with the NXP FRDM-KL28Z Microcontroller.

---

Each lab has its own directory. The starter code (e.g., headers, drivers, setup scaffolding) has been provided by my professors. The logic I have implemented is in the 'main.c' file in the 'src' folder of each lab. In some cases, I made edits/additions to other files, but the primary contributions are in `main.c`.

## Lab Overview

Labs 1–5 implement cyclic systems using polling, interrupts, PWM, and ADC. Labs 6–7 introduce RTOS threads and inter-thread communication, including message queues and terminal commands. Each lab has it's own README description, as well as the code being explained in the main.c file.
