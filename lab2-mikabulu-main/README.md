# Lab 2 

The code:

  * Changes the direction of the LED turned on when button B1 is pressed (LED1 to LED5/LED5 to LED1).
  * Inverses the LEDs so all LEDs are lit except the one previously lit when button B5 is pressed. 

B1 is polled. Button B5 is handled by an interrupt (possible because it has hardware debounce).
