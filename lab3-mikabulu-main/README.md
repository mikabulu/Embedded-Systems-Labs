# Lab 3 Given Code 

The code:
  * Records the reaction time taken to press buttom B5 when the light flashes green after a random wait time.
  * Flashes red if the button is pressed before the light flahes green, flashes green when time has been recorded. 

Button B5 is handled by an interrupt (possible because it has hardware debounce).

The code also configures two further outputs, for use with the oscilloscope. These
are set and cleared as described in the lab sheet.
